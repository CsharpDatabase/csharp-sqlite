# NOTE: this file is for git 1.6.6 (and possibly older)
# Post-1.7.2 there is eol and text, and crlf is deprecated
# but we can't depend on an unreleased version...

# This file mainly controls line ending conversion behaviour, if
# the user has the setting core.autocrlf true.

# The meaning of the attributes is a little odd
# -crlf means DO NOT convert line endings
# crlf means CONVERT to lf in the repo & Linux/Mac, crlf on Windows

# First, turn off git line ending handling except on a case-by-case basis
# because our repo isn't normalized, in general.
# There are even files with mixed line endings.
*	-crlf

# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
* text=auto

# sln is always CRLF, even on linux, so don't convert
*.sln	-crlf

# These files can be converted, since they're new
.gitattributes	crlf
.gitignore	crlf

# Having proj files as crlf on windows will make VS happier
# MD can deal with (and preserve) either, so it doesn't matter.
# Unfortunately MD creates with LF, so we need to convert these.
*proj	crlf

*.sh	eol=lf
