    *	queue. It returns 1 for all events that should be deleted and
    *	0 for events that should remain in the queue.
    *
    *	If this method determines that an event should be removed, it
    *	should perform appropriate clean up on the event object.
    *
    * Results:
    *	1 means evt should be removed from the event queue. 0
    *	otherwise.
    *
    * Side effects:
    *	After this method returns 1, the event will be removed from the
    *	event queue and will not be processed.
